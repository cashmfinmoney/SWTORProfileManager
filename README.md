# SWTORProfileManager
🎮 CashMfinMoney's SWTOR Profile Manager – FREE TOOL

Hey SWTOR players! I built a simple, no-setup-needed .exe tool that lets you save, load, and manage multiple graphics/settings profiles for SWTOR. Super useful if you switch between different setups (like PvP, raiding, low-end potato mode, etc).

How to use: 
1) Run the "compiler.bat" file to create the .exe
2) Place the "Cash's SWTOR Profile Manager.exe" somewhere convenient.
3) Run "Cash's SWTOR Profile Manager.exe"

Note: You can save your graphics at any time.
Note: SWTOR must be closed to load a profile.
Note: Enjoy!

✅ Features:

💾 Save your current client_settings.ini as a named profile

🔄 Instantly load any saved profile

🗑️ Delete unwanted profiles (with confirmation)

📁 All profiles stored in a neat Profiles folder in your SWTOR settings

⚠️ Warns you to close SWTOR before loading a profile, with optional auto-close

🖼️ Splash screen with donation QR + links to my YouTube, Twitch, TikTok

🧠 Built to be portable – just drop the .exe anywhere and run it.

🧑‍💻 I made this for fun and for the community. I'm a new full-time creator & student trying to grow — so if you like the tool, consider following me or dropping a donation (no pressure at all!).

📎 No install. No config. Just click and go.
